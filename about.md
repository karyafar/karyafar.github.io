I am Kamelia Aryafar, Vice President, Head of Data Science, Machine Learning and AI at Overstock.com Inc., an online retailer. I lead the core machine learning, data science, marketing data science and personalization teams focused on building scalable machine learning, natural language processing, deep learning and computer vision tools to curate a personalized experience for Overstock users. 

Prior to Overstock I have been a Senior Machine Learning and Data Scientist at Etsy Inc., an e-commerce platform for handmade and vintage goods for more than four years.

Before Etsy, I was doing a Ph.D. in computer science and machine learning, building large-scale classification and information retrieval models.
